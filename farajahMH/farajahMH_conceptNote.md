## Overview
The chatbot is the product of a workflow that begins with the INSPIRE data warehouse which hosts and links data from EHR records, population health studies and community conversational records between patients and community health workers. Next steps are taken by a schema.org JSON-LD DataCatalog through which warehouse (meta)data is projected into machine actionable Datasets that have and use their knowhow to move these Datasets into an OMOP CDM instance. Using the OHDSI methods library (HADES), here cohorts are constructed and features are extracted through whch prediction models are discovered that relate "idioms of distress", other observations and covariates with depression, anxiety and psychosis (DAP) health outcomes over time. These models are stored for downstream use. Downstream the OMOP CDM instance is converted into a Croissant dataset by the MIT Croissant-baker. Croissant datasets can be used to fine tune a bespoke LLM in our case with mental health knowledge on the HuggingFace and PyTorch platform. Feature selection during this fine tuning is informed by the model(s) that the OHDSI methods library has built.

## INSPIRE Data Warehouse
The warehouse hosts:
* digitized clinical archives in an EHR card format
* multiple waves of HDSS survey data
* community conversational records

The warehouse is structured as follows:

<br />
This structure is closely aligned with LOINC. LOINC is a common language (set of identifiers, names, and codes) for identifying and describing health measurements, observations, panels of measurements, panels of observations (including questionnaires) and reports:

<br />
In the data warehouse there are facts that corresponds to LOINC observations and measurements. And the different parts of a fully specified observation or measurement in LOINC above like "code", "component", "property", "time" and so forth largely correspond to the dimensions of the data warehouse.
<br /><br />
INSPIRE data warehouse development is led by Dorothy Mailosi with assistance from Jay Greenfield.

## Mental Health DataCatalog
The Mental Heaith DataCatalog has several components:
* The catalog itself is a schema.org DataCatalog which is a collection of one or more schema.org Datasets rendered in JSON-LD format.
* The catalog has an authoring tool that generates the schema.org JSON-LD datasets that we draw from the data warehouse
* Each dataset in the catalog includes a knowledgebase that a coding agent can use to create concepts in a OMOP CDM community vocabulary for the DAP "idioms of distress" under the direction of clinical expertise and lived experience
* Each dataset in the catalog includes a knowledgebase that a coding agent can use to create observations, measurements and visit occurrences in an OMOP CDM instance using concepts from this community vocabulary as needed

A catalog with this functionality is not new. Parts of it have been developed already in another project the CODATA team is participating -- the OHDSI GIS WG. And the OHDSI GIS WG itself and its initiative called the gaiaCatalog has been guided by work started at the University of Miami. That being said, hosting a knowledgebase for AI agents is experimental and is still very much a work in progress. Success with agentic AI in these early times will take a significant effort.
<br /><br />
This being said, David Amadi will lead authoring and catalog entry generation except he will need support from the CODATA team (Doug and Letisha) when it comes to the parts of the catalog that an AI coding agent might use first to create concepts iteratively under the direction of clinical expertise and lived experience and then to populate measurments and observations in an OMOP CDM instance using these concepts.

Conversion of an OMOP CDM instance into a Croissant dataset by the MIT Croissant-baker is a work in progress. See
