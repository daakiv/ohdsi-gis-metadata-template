# KoboToolbox Metadata Authoring

This folder documents the KoboToolbox/XLSForm-based metadata authoring workflow being developed for the [Gaia Catalog](https://github.com/OHDSI/gaiaCatalog) and OHDSI GIS metadata pipeline.

The workflow supports the transition from a legacy spreadsheet-based metadata process into a more structured, reusable, and machine-actionable authoring approach. It uses:

- **KoboToolbox** for structured metadata capture and interface management.
- **Raw Kobo JSON exports** as the source records.
- **SSSOM-style mapping files** ([Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings](https://w3id.org/sssom)) for explicit semantic translation rules.
- **JSON-LD outputs** strictly aligned with [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and [Science-on-Schema.org (SOSO)](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/main/guides/Dataset.md#roles-of-people) recommendations.

## Purpose

The KoboToolbox form serves as a structured metadata authoring interface for geospatial datasets intended for Gaia Catalog ingestion and downstream machine-readable metadata generation.

The goal is to support consistent metadata capture across geospatial use cases — including vector, raster, tabular, and sensor-based datasets — while reducing manual transformation work and improving the reproducibility of metadata outputs.

## Why this approach

The previous workflow relied on manually maintained spreadsheet templates. The KoboToolbox-based workflow improves:

| Aspect                      | Benefit                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency**             | Structured form fields reduce free-text variation and improve metadata consistency.                                    |
| **Validation**              | Entry-time checks help catch missing values, type errors, and required-field issues before export.                     |
| **Controlled vocabularies** | Dropdown and select responses support the use of standardized terms and reduce ambiguity.                              |
| **Scalability**             | The workflow supports metadata authoring by multiple contributors across different datasets and use cases.             |
| **Interoperability**        | Raw Kobo metadata can be transformed into JSON-LD aligned with Schema.org and Science-on-Schema.org (`soso`) patterns. |
| **Traceability**            | The workflow provides a clear chain from raw Kobo record → SSSOM mapping → generated JSON-LD output.                   |
